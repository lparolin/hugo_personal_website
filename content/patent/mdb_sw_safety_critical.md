abstract = "According to some embodiments, a system includes a communication device operative to communicate with a user to obtain the one or more requirements associated with a specification model for a semantic module; a semantic module to receive the one or more requirements, store the one or more requirements and transform the one or more requirements into a semantic model; a specification module to receive the semantic model, store the semantic model, translate the semantic model and generate a specification model; a memory for storing program instructions; at least one specification model platform processor, coupled to the memory, and in communication with the specification module and the semantic module and operative to execute program instructions to: transform the one or more requirements into a semantic model by executing the semantic module; translate the semantic model into a graphical model by executing the specification module; and modify the graphical model by executing the specification module to generate the specification model; and generate a specification model that is human-readable and computer-readable for use in software design. Numerous other aspects are provided."
