abstract = "Approaches for a modeling and estimation approach for a virtual flow meter (VFM) are described. Certain aspects of the present virtual flow meter approaches relate to the manner in which multiple sources of information in the field are merged within a filter framework for estimation. In certain implementations, both mass flow and pressure at every node of the field are considered as part of the state estimated by the filter algorithm."
