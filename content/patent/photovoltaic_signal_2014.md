abstract = "A system for online filtering of photovoltaic (PV) output signals includes a programmable filter that is programmed to decompose measured PV output power into an estimated low-frequency signal component, based substantially on movement of the sun and an estimated high-frequency signal component, based substantially on cloud shading. An open loop controller generates a reactive power compensation signal based on at least one of the low-frequency signal component and the high-frequency signal component. The low-frequency signal component is defined by a positive portion of a sine curve that is based substantially on movement of the sun."
