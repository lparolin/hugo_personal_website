abstract = "A sensor system for identifying a transient sensor failure in an industrial system and for recovering from an erroneous estimation of an expected mass flow rate resulting from the transient sensor failure. The sensor system includes one or more sensors for measuring at least one fluid property of the industrial system. The sensor system includes an enhanced flow soft sensing (EFSS) computing device configured to determine an estimated mass flow rate. The EFSS computing device is also configured to generate expected measurements to be received from one or more sensors. If an error value is not within predetermined parameters, the transient sensor failure is detected. The EFSS computing device is further configured to identify a resurgence of the sensor from the transient sensor failure. An erroneous expected mass flow rate then converges toward a correct expected mass flow rate."
